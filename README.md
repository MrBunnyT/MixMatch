# MixMatch

Project in progress and currently only has three template pages made using Typescript in react and some basic javascript code for grabbing the variables in the form.
Current routes in react:
1. /Auth/Login
![Login Page](https://github.com/MrBunnyT/MixMatch/blob/master/ReadmeAssets/WebTech1.PNG?raw=true)
2. /Auth/Signup
![Signup Page](https://github.com/MrBunnyT/MixMatch/blob/master/ReadmeAssets/WebTech1.PNG?raw=true)
3. /
![Home Page](https://github.com/MrBunnyT/MixMatch/blob/master/ReadmeAssets/WebTech1.PNG?raw=true)

The Backend is configured but won't actually work without a databse connected, also the Backend and frontend are not yet integrated together.
go in to Frontend/mixmatchui and use "npm start" to run the react server on ur localhost
